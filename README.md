# Random_Matrices_Properties

Thir project inspects various properties of random matrices such as their 2-norms and eigenvalues.

The random matrices are generated by the following matlab method 
A = randn(m,m)/sqrt(m)) to remove any limiting behaviour as m approaches zero
m is selected as follows m = 8, 16, 32, 64, ..., to get 100 random matrices and after that eigen values and 2-norm of 100 matrices are superimposed in a single figure to observe the patterns
